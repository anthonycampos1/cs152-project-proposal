				<h3 class="animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-4s">Introduction:</h3>
				<p class="animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-4s">I am to train neural networks (NNs) to predict the winning side of bets offered by popular sports betting apps and sportsbooks. The NN will be trained on relevant data, including team performance from previous seasons, individual player statistics, and, if time permits, dynamic data such as recent player injuries or other major news updates.</p>
				<p class="animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-4s">There are potential applications to major sports leagues, such as the National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA), and Major League Baseball (MLB). Datasets containing historical seasonal data are freely available on Kaggle for the
				<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bendikfltaas/nba-history-seasonal-data-1995-2023">NBA</a>, 
				<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kendallgillies/nflstatistics">NFL</a>, 
				<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joyshil0599/mlb-hitting-and-pitching-stats-through-the-years)">MLB</a></p>. 
				<p class="animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-4s">Once trained, the neural network will be deployed by providing it with bets as input and recording the success rate of its output.</p>
				<p class="animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-4s">The primary objective is to determine whether a neural network can generate a hypothetical profit based on real-world sports bets. Further, the project may also touch on risk management strategies to maintain profitability. A potential avenue for further exploration includes training and comparing multiple modelsâ€”one trained on high-risk, high-reward bets, while another trained on lower-risk, low return bets. It would also be interesting to see if this NN model could be modified to formulate parlay bets.</p>
